<blockquote>
<p>Instead of asking the government to bear the cost of higher education, students should pay their tuition fees themselves. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Model Essay</strong></p>
<p>Some people consider it necessary for the government to subsidies all universities to ensure that all eligible students can attend college free of charge. I do not agree with this idea, although students of low socio-economic status can be exempt(免除)  from tuition fees.</p>
<p>Tuition fees can <strong>raise student’s engagement</strong> as the staggering(惊人的) financial cost may pressure them to take this opportunity more seriously. They may finance their education with their own saving or the money borrowed from relatives(亲戚), so they would do the utmost(最大努力) to complete all courses and obtain a degree as soon as possible. If they fail to pass any exam or gain a passing grade for any assignment, they might have to delay the plan to enter the workforce. This may incur(招致) a higher cost than they can afford. This <em>sense of urgency</em> would disappear if they had free access to education. Absenteeism(旷课) and passing rates of each subject would increase markedly, making it difficult for a <em>tertiary institution(大专院校)</em> to operate effectively. </p>
<p>Another reason for charging tuition is that it can <em>lighten the burden on</em> the government and increase financial resources available for other levels of education. University students have reached adulthood when they are capable of earning a living. If they <em>place value on</em> academic qualifications, they can <em>set aside(搁置,预留)</em> part of their income to finance their degree courses. By comparison, primary and secondary education deserve more of government expenditure as students are still deemed as minors(被视为未成年人), who are not legally permitted to work as paid employees. <strong>Postgraduate programmers are also in need of financial support form the state, without which universities would lose the battle with the private sector for talented researchers.</strong></p>
<p>On the other side, it may be reasonable to make some exceptions and provide less well-off(小康,阔绰的) students with free education. Free tuitions can encourage these young students to attend college and increase knowledge so they are able to find employment in this knowledge-based economy. Without a <em>tertiary-level qualification(大专学历)</em>, they might end up working in low-paid, manual work, while their counterparts from <em>well-off backgrounds</em> dominate the high-paying, professional jobs, such as medicine and law, which require advanced qualifications. <strong>This can perpetuate(永存) the income disparity problem of a economy.</strong> </p>
<p>To sum up, students from disadvantages backgrounds can be exempt from tuition fees, while it is not acceptable to abolish tuition fees for everyone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is better for students to live away from home while studying at university than to live with parents. To what extend do you agree or disagree?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Model Essay</strong></p>
<p>Many college students choose to move out of their parental home and live in university accommodation or share flats with friends. In my opinion, they can benefit from this option, although their <em>bonding</em> with family may suffer.</p>
<p><em>One benefit of leaving home is that</em> young people can develop independence. Without the support and guidance of parents, they should make decisions independently on a wide range of issues, such as <em>the length of the lease(租约期限)</em>, choosing a flatmate(室友) and refurnishing the flat they rent if necessary. Apart from the decision-making ability, they also develop a variety of skills, including managing the monthly budget and keeping a house, which can prepare them for challenges in their working lives. For example, tidying up the bedroom every day is fundamentally an organizational skill, which is essential when they expect to keep office documents in an orderly fashion and complete routine tasks efficiently when they enter the workforce.</p>
<p>Living separately from parents also mean that young people can enjoy greater freedom in social life and enhance interpersonal skills. They do not need to go home every day and report to parents about their daily activities, so they have more free time to make new friends , such as joining some clubs. going to the gym, attending parities and even taking up a part-time job. <strong>They can sharpen their social skills by conversing with people from <em>all walks of life</em> in different settings. They can build a network of contacts, which is of value to their career in the future as they have more personal resource to draw upon.</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, some young people should be aware that they may have to combat the sense of loneliness when living apart from family. They may not be able to eat meals with parents every day to enjoy the bonding with family and solicit advice when they experience difficulties in their education. In order to maintain a sense of independence, some students may choose to hide their feelings even when they cannot cope with challenges alone. They will stay aloof from parents after graduation, as they do not see the value in maintaining close contact with family. </p>
<p>To sum up, I agree with the idea of living independently when young people start university, despite the possible impact on family life.</p>
